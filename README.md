## A node.js testbed
This is a project that serves s a testbed for my node.js demo applications. It currently contains two projects
1. a vary basic 'Hello World' node.js application server. 
2. a chat server that demonstrates basic express and socket.io usage.

### Hello World Project
This is my first node.js project. My first server exists in nodeserver.

### Chat Server Project
While a chat-example based on node.js and socket.io can be found in chat-example directory (based on [socket.io tutorial] (http://socket.io/get-started/chat))
